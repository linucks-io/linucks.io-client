Check out a live demo [here](https://linucks-io.github.io/linucks.io-client/).


**linucks.io** is a web application where you can test out a range of Linux distros before actually installing in on your system.


Linux is a popular kernel which is used mainly by developers because of the many benefits. Since there are a number of flavours of GNU/Linux, there
are many options to choose from, which can be quite confusing for the user.

**linucks.io** is a one-stop solution for distro-hopping. With this application, we try the user by simulating a virtual environment of the distro of the user's choice. This is the repository for the frontend of the web-application, you can check out the backend on [https://github.com/linucks-io/linucks.io-service/](https://github.com/linucks-io/linucks.io-service/). Every time a user clicks on a distro, a request is sent to the backend, which allocates a docker image for that cluster and returns a SSL encrypted websocket URL for it, which can be accessed using [noVNC](https://github.com/novnc/noVNC) on the browser.
